# EODHD Endpoint Reference (Index)

This file now serves as a high-level index. Detailed notes for each endpoint
live in the per-endpoint stubs under `skills/eodhd-api/references/endpoints/`.

## Where to edit
- Per-endpoint stubs: `skills/eodhd-api/references/endpoints/README.md`
- Individual endpoint files: `skills/eodhd-api/references/endpoints/*.md`

## Notes
- Fill each stub with confirmed paths, parameters, and response examples.
- Endpoint availability and fields vary by subscription level.
